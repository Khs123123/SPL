# BGU SPL ‚Äì Systems Programming Laboratory

## üìò Course Overview

**Systems Programming** is the discipline of writing software that manages and interacts directly with computing systems, rather than providing end-user services. Unlike application developers, system programmers build tools, libraries, and services that are consumed by other software components.

This course, taught at **Ben-Gurion University**, explores how programs interact with the **Run-Time Environment (RTE)**, and provides students with practical experience in writing efficient, low-level, and system-level software.

## üéØ Course Topics

Throughout the course, we studied and implemented core system programming concepts, including:

- **Memory management** and address spaces
- **Concurrency** using multi-threading and multi-processing
- **Object-Oriented Design**, patterns, and software principles
- **Interprocess communication (IPC)** using RPCs and sockets
- **Networking fundamentals**, including the TCP/IP layered model
- **Data storage**, from file systems to relational databases
- **Application protocols** such as HTTP
- **Scripting** for automation and system control

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Languages

We used a variety of programming languages and tools to explore system-level development:

- **C++** ‚Äì for low-level memory and process control
- **Java** ‚Äì for object-oriented design and networking
- **Python** ‚Äì for scripting and prototyping
- **SQL** ‚Äì for working with relational databases
